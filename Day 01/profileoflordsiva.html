	<p>Lord Shiva, a key deity in Hinduism, is often referred to as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti (Hindu trinity), alongside Brahma (creator) and Vishnu (preserver), responsible for the cycle of destruction and renewal in the universe; he is revered in Shaivism as the supreme god, usually depicted as an ascetic Yogi residing on Mount Kailash, with his consort Parvati, and is known for his third eye, the Ganges river flowing from his matted hair, and the trishula (trident) as his weapon; his primary symbol is the lingam, a phallic representation of divine energy; Shiva is also considered the patron of yoga and meditation, often portrayed with a calm and contemplative demeanor, but can also manifest in fierce forms to destroy evil forces.</p>
